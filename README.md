# node-twitter-starter
A NodeJS server using ExpressJS to get started with basic GET operations via Twitter API.

Current operations are fetching tweets of any user, fetching a user's likes, fetching tweets from a list, fetching a tweet by ID, fetch a user's following list and searching twitter for tweets. All tweets are fetched with Extended Tweet Mode enabled to support 280 characters.

# Getting Started
1. Obtain your twitter consumer key and onsumer secret from dev.twitter.com/apps and add them in config.js.
2. npm install
3 .node server.js

For active development, I suggest using nodemon.
